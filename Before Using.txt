Welcome to Event Manager
I'm sending a Maven project. I'm using Spring with Hibernate. I'm sending only the "src" file so you can easily import it.
Before you "Run" the program, you should have working MySql server. For the database I'm using HeidiSql so you should have this tool too.
There is an "application.properties file" in the resource folder, you should go there and change the "username" and "password" to your personal settings which HeidiSql is using,
so Spring can create a database for you.
Enough with the setting.
After you connected successfully to the database and "Start" the application. Open you favorite browser, I prefer Chrome.
Type "http://localhost:8000/" in the searching section, press "Enter" and the "home page" of the app should appear on your screen.
There is a navigation bar at the top with 3 links on it the first which is "Event Manager" links to the "home page",
the second which is the "Create event" links to the creation of an event, the third which is the "Show all Events" links to list with events.
 When you click on "Create event", a form displays where you can create an event after typing the data in the form and clicking the button "Create"
 your event will be saved in to the database, and the page will redirect to show your saved event.
If you forgot a filed empty it won't create the event and will tell you where is your mistake. 
In the "List section", which displays after clicking on the link at the navigation or creating an event, you can edit and delete the event.
After clicking the edit button you will see a form with the name and the location of the event.
If you want you can edit the event and after clicking the "Edit" button the event will be saved in the database.
That is all hope you like it.
